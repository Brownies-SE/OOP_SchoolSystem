# OOP_SchoolSystem

This OOP School System is used to practice object oriented programming. It uses encapsulation (Setters and getters to grab the private variables in each object).
There are 3 objects (Students, Teachers, School). These objects are used in the SchoolSystem.java file. I use an arrayList to add teacher and students to the school object. From there you can print and see the teachers and students you have in your school.
